# Datasets
The datasets utilized in this work can be accessed from [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iP7KRFwkS6K4Hako1XQIgg) (code:2r9f), including ORSSD, EORSSD, ORSI-4199 and RSISOD.

# Salmaps
The salmaps can be accessed from [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1RfqKLIB0R5ltQBTlR02Deg) (code:RAGR), including ORSSD, EORSSD, ORSI-4199 and RSISOD.

# Evaluation Tool
You can use the evaluation tool [(MATLAB version)](https://github.com/MathLee/MatlabEvaluationTools) to evaluate the above saliency maps.

# New üö©
We provide saliency maps in [BaiDuYunlink](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1oPEx9PNamHkxRKDNyGsV8w)(code:RAGR) for UGSet Dataset.
